This Android project requires an **API Key** to function correctly. To ensure the application can access the necessary services (Weather API), you must add your **API Key** to the `local.properties` configuration file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** to your local environment.
2. Get or create your API Key from [Weather Api](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/)

3. Add your API Key with the name API_KEY to the local.properties file. 

```properties
  API_KEY="YourAPIKeyHere"
```
3. Build and run the project

After adding the API Key, you can build and run the app as usual in Android Studio.
Ensure that the API Key has been correctly configured. If the value is missing or incorrect, the app may not function as expected.
